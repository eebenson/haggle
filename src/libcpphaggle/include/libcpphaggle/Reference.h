/**
   The Reference class is used for refcounting any type of object. This is done
   without having to make any changes at all to the class being refcounted.
	
   The main use for these references is for passing objects in events. Anyone 
   receiving that event can therefore keep a copy of the reference to that 
   object without having to worry about the object being deleted. An object is
   deleted automatically when there are no longer any references to that 
   object.
	
   The aim here is to make the references as invisible as possible. The ideal 
   is to be able to treat a reference as a pointer to the object. Unfortunately
   this is not always possible. These references can't really point to object
   allocated on the stack, since it tries to assume control of destruction of 
   the object, so some care must be taken to make sure that doesn't happen.
