# Log event definition file for Haggle

# This is how often in milliseconds vclient will report to the
# monitor that is still alive. Note that it has nothing to do
# with the program!
<PING_INTERVALL>
	1000
</PING_INTERVALL>

# This is the only log event we use. We will report when the
# ping program outputs that it has received a reply to an
# request. The type -- or name -- of the event is LE_EVENT.
# We'll just send the complete line from haggle to the monitor
# by using the send_plain method. The regular expression
# `regexp' defines which lines to send.
# By specifying `net=tcp' we state that we want the data to
# be sent to the monitor over TCP.
<LOGEVENT>

# We do not care, since we will use TCP only.
