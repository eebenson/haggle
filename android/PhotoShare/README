In order to compile, you need Eclipse with the Android SDK installed. 
You also need to setup the path to the libhaggle java bindings. First 
build libhaggle with the Java bindings, then point Eclipse to the haggle.jar
file that is built. This is done under 'Project->Properties->Java Build Path'
in Eclipse.
